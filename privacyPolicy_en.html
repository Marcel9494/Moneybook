    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Responsible Entity</h2>
    <p>
        The entity responsible for data processing in connection with this app is:
    </p>
    <p>
        Marcel Geirhos<br>
        Gartenstra√üe 8, 73550 Waldstetten<br>
        <a href="mailto:Marcel.Geirhos@gmail.com">Marcel.Geirhos@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy at a Glance</h2>
    <p>
        This app stores all data (bookings, accounts, budgets, and categories) exclusively on the user's device.
        The data is solely used for display in the user interface. No data is shared with third parties. Cookies or
        other tracking mechanisms are not used.
    </p>

    <h2>Collection and Storage of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
        This app does not collect, process, or store any personal data beyond what the user enters locally within the app.
        No transmission of this data to external servers or third parties takes place.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Devices and Sensors</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not use the device's camera, microphone, or GPS functionalities. No data from these sources is collected or stored.
    </p>

    <h2>Anonymized Usage Analysis with PostHog</h2>

    <p>
        We use the open-source tool PostHog to analyze the usage of our app. This is done solely for the purpose of improving the user-friendliness and functionality of our app. Only anonymized usage data is collected, e.g., how often certain buttons or functions are used.
    </p>

    <p>
        The data is collected without personal data. In particular, no IP addresses, device identifiers, or personally identifiable information is collected or stored. Instead, a randomly generated, anonymous ID is used, which is only stored locally on the device. It is not possible to draw conclusions about individual users.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data processing is carried out via the PostHog Cloud, operated on servers within the European Union. No data is transferred to third countries (e.g., the USA).
    </p>

    <p>
        The analysis is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in optimizing our app. The collected data is not passed on to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        No data stored within the app is shared with third parties. All data remains locally on the user's device.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on the device, the user is responsible for protecting it.
        We recommend securing the device against unauthorized access (e.g., through passwords or biometric lock mechanisms).
    </p>

    <h2>Availability of the App</h2>
    <p>
        This app is currently available only in the following countries:
		<ul>
			<li>Germany</li>
			<li>Austria</li>
			<li>Swizerland</li>
			<li>United States</li>
		</ul>
		and is exclusively intended for users in these countries.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since no data is stored on external servers, typical rights such as access, correction, or deletion
        are directly related to the locally stored data. Users can delete all data at any time by uninstalling the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to update this privacy policy as needed to reflect legal or technical changes.
        The latest version is available within the app and via the Google Play Store.
