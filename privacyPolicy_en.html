    <h2>Privacy at a Glance</h2>
    <p>
        This app stores all data (bookings, accounts, budgets, and categories) exclusively on the user's device.
        The data is solely used for display in the user interface. No data is shared with third parties. Cookies or
        other tracking mechanisms are not used.
    </p>

    <h2>Collection and Storage of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
        This app does not collect, process, or store any personal data beyond what the user enters locally within the app.
        No transmission of this data to external servers or third parties takes place.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Devices and Sensors</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not use the device's camera, microphone, or GPS functionalities. No data from these sources is collected or stored.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        No data stored within the app is shared with third parties. All data remains locally on the user's device.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on the device, the user is responsible for protecting it.
        We recommend securing the device against unauthorized access (e.g., through passwords or biometric lock mechanisms).
    </p>

    <h2>Availability of the App</h2>

		</ul>
		and is exclusively intended for users in these countries.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since no data is stored on external servers, typical rights such as access, correction, or deletion
        are directly related to the locally stored data. Users can delete all data at any time by uninstalling the app.
    </p>
